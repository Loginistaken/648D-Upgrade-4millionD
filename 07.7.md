## A. 1‑Page Experimental Checklist (Prototype path: High‑fidelity, cryo)

### Goal

Implement a nondestructive spectral-label readout for a biphoton frequency comb (BFC) 
using Eu³⁺/Pr³⁺ cavity dispersive coupling and a weak alexandrite tap for human-visible color labeling. 
Demonstrate <5% main-path loss from tap, measurable dispersive probe phase shift (SNR ≥ 5), 
and preserved entanglement witnesses (HOM/Franson contrast within 80–95% of baseline).

### Equipment & components (buy/borrow)

* Eu³⁺\:Y₂SiO₅ and Pr³⁺\:Y₂SiO₅ crystal samples (small polished pieces).
* Alexandrite (Cr³⁺) sample, thin slab or coated wafer for tap arm.
* High-Q microcavity (fiber-cavity or chip microdisk) compatible with 580–605 nm
* region (or tuned to target transition), with input/output coupling.
* Cryostat (closed-cycle dilution or He cryostat) with optical access; base temp <4 K (target 1.5–4 K depending on coherence goals).
* Narrow-line lasers for addressing relevant rare-earth transitions (tunable CW lasers, kHz linewidth preferred).
* Low-noise probe laser for dispersive readout (detuned from resonance).
* Fiber directional couplers / tap couplers (1%, 3%, 5% options).
* Electro-optic (thin-film LiNbO₃) modulators for frequency-bin gates and EO bias control.
* OAM mode mappers / MPLC elements (if testing OAM expansion later).
* Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) for main path coincidences
* (high efficiency, low jitter), or equivalent low-noise detectors.
* Fast photodiode / camera for alexandrite monitor arm.
* Temperature sensors: NTC/PT1000 (room-temp) and cryo thermometers (Cernox/Si diode) mounted on comb, SPDC crystal, cavity, and OAM optics.
* Data acquisition & control: FPGA/DAQ for time tagging, lock-in amplifier for dispersive readout,
* real‑time controller (LabVIEW/Python) for Stability Index and mask/unmask routines.

### Parameter targets & acceptance thresholds

* **Tap loss:** ≤ 5% loss in main quantum path (measure coincidence rate before/after tap). Acceptance: pass if ≤ 5%.
* **Cavity Q / coupling:** target loaded Q that yields measurable phase shift with minimal
*  photon absorption. Acceptance: probe SNR ≥ 5 for single‑photon-level conditioned events
*  (or for weak coherent test pulses, scale to single‑photon expectation).
* **Dispersive backaction:** probe-induced decoherence/backaction
*  < 10% (measured as reduction in HOM/Franson contrast). Acceptance: contrast ≥ 80% of baseline.
* **Thermal stability:** Stability Index keeps bin center drift < 0.1 linewidth over target run time (hours).
* Acceptance: auto‑masking reduces degraded bins until fringe visibility restored > target.
* **Entanglement certification:** witnesses/Schmidt lower bounds consistent with multi‑mode entanglement
*  (show at least no significant drop vs baseline after readout operations). Acceptance: witness/significance
*  comparable to baseline within experimental error.

### Stepwise flow (lab flow)

1. **Bench-check sources & detectors (room temp):** verify comb / SPDC source, calibrate AWG/filters, check SNSPDs & time-tagging.
2. **Add weak tap + alexandrite monitor:** route small fraction to alexandrite slab + camera/PD.
3. Measure effect on coincidence rate; adjust tap to meet ≤5% loss.
4. **Integrate cavity + rare‑earth sample at room temp:** align cavity modes, measure spectrum,
5. test dispersive probe behavior using bright pulses/coherent states.
6. **Install cryostat & cool rare-earth cavity:** measure optical linewidths and coherence
7. times at base temp; tune probe detuning & coupling for dispersive regime.
8. **Probe benchmarking:** inject weak pulses conditioned on heralds; measure probe phase
9. shift and SNR; adjust cavity Q/coupling for optimal SNR/backaction tradeoff.
10. **Full system test:** run BFC SPDC source through full chain; measure HOM/Franson
11. revivals, spectral correlations, and entanglement witnesses with readout active vs off.
12. **Stability Index & masking:** enable thermal telemetry, compute Stability Index,
13. demonstrate auto masking/unmasking of marginal bins during induced thermal perturbation.
14. **Document & iterate:** record acceptance metrics; iterate cavity coupling, probe power, and tap ratio to meet targets.

### Timeline (suggested rapid path)

* **Weeks 0–2:** procure components, order crystals and alexandrite sample; set up DAQ and detectors.
* **Weeks 3–6:** bench tests (comb/SPDC, detectors, tap arm).
* **Weeks 7–10:** cavity integration & room-temp dispersive tests.
* **Weeks 11–16:** cryostat integration, cooldown, measure coherence & dispersive SNR.
* **Weeks 17–22:** full-system entanglement tests + stability automation. Deliver prototype report.

## Quick implementation notes & heuristics

* **Tap ratio:** start 1% then step to 3% or 5% only if alexandrite signal insufficient. Always verify main-path
* coincidence loss after change. Aim for ≤5% loss.
* **Probe detuning:** operate probe several linewidths detuned (dispersive regime) to gain phase
* shift without absorption; tune power to maximize SNR but keep backaction small.
* **Thermal anchors:** place cryo thermometers on cavity mount and on rare-earth crystal.
* Use room‑temp thermistors on comb/EO gear. Implement PID loops for slow drifts and Stability Index for higher-level decisions.
* **Certification:** use HOM/Franson revivals, spectral correlation matrices,
* and compressed-sensing witnesses for high‑D certification rather than exhaustive tomography.
