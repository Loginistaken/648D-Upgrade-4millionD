üß© SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Goal:
To create a Quantum-Capable Crystal Processing Unit capable of encoding, storing, and decoding symbolic
(A‚ÄìZ) data using frequency combs and rare-earth-doped crystal memory, with color-based visualization and FPGA-managed control.

Core Principle:
Information (letters A‚ÄìZ) is represented as distinct optical frequencies, injected into and read 
from a rare-earth-doped crystal at cryogenic temperature. The quantum memory preserves coherence
